You have to first change the hwid of your arduino leonardo to match your mouse's hwid, and then just make a basic arduino script that reads the incoming bytes and moves the cursor to the cords in recieved packets,
use mouse.h lib in arduino

also used a serial communication lib from somewhere on the internet which i cant find right now :( any serial com li will do just fine just read the functions <3
